# FaceRecognitionApp
Java face recognition app using haars

Warning: The app is pretty bad in effectiveness right now (04.10.2017). Need to implement Flandmark liblary (or dlib) but so far too frustrated with it.
After implementing more precise landmark detection method should work fine (yeah, easy to say). The project is a good base if your
intention is to focus mainly on facial points.
